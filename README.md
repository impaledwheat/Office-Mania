# Office-Mania
A text-based game based on the hit NBC TV Series "The Office."
Hello y'all! This text-based video game is a personal project I am writing to teach myself programming, game design, and, specifically in this case, C#. I'm a big fan of The Office, and like many of you, am dismayed that it will be leaving Netflix. Oh, well. Such is life.
If you'd like to suggest ideas for the game, feel free to do so! I won't be distributing this game for money if it ever comes to fruition, as I don't want to have to deal with licenses and stuff from NBC. At most, it would be put up for free on Steam or itch.io.
